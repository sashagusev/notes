Yes, I've just arrived here from the 90's and am keeping a link roll, now I'm off to Blockbuster to rent some VHS and see how Seinfeld ended. Seriously though there's a lot of informal writing going on in genetics but it is often scattered. This list is as much for me to keep track as for the public good. Please email any additional links you feel are relevant. The list is not an endorsement, is ordered alphabetically, and classified in the [traditional style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_Emporium_of_Benevolent_Knowledge).
