I am a postdoc studying quantitative genetics. These are my stray thoughts on recent work in the field. I hope to keep the ranting to a minimum. Papers I have been involved in are available [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mRCDpEIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). I am constantly inspired by the talented people that I work with. Leave a comment or get in touch with me by email at *{the letter "s"}{my last name}@gmail.com*.
